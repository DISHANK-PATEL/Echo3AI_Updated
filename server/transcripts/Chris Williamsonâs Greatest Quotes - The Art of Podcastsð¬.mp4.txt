 The art of podcasts, this is a quote that I've fallen in love with, is beautifully called. The magic you are looking for is in the work you're avoiding. The best way to win the game is to stop moving the goldpuffs. The thing that is making you better is the thing which is making you feel pain. Life needs to be lived forward but only makes sense in reverse. Problems are a feature of life, not on both. The real pain in life is getting to the end of it and realizing that you left something on the table. Heroes and villains always have the same backstory here. Pain, the differences, what they choose to do about it. Villains say, the world hurt me, I'll hurt it back. The hero says, the world hurt me, I'm not going to let it hurt anybody else.
